  ```python
  def authenticate_twitter_v2():
      BEARER_TOKEN = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'  # Replace this
      client = tweepy.Client(bearer_token=BEARER_TOKEN)
      return client
  ```

### 4. Run All Cells
- Click "Runtime" ‚Üí "Run all"
- Or run cells one by one using Shift+Enter

### 5. View Results
